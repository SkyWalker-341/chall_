# 🔐 Rise of Skywalker — Web + SSH + Forensics Challenge

## 🧠 Challenge Concept

A multi-stage CTF challenge that blends web exploitation, dynamic authentication via SSH, log analysis, and race condition exploitation.

 ## Part - 1

### Level 1: ICMP (Ping Protocol)

- **Task:** The hidden flag is embedded within a series of IP addresses sent via ICMP packets.
- **Hint:** The IP addresses contain noise (extra numerical values). Participants must filter and decode these values to reveal the flag.

### Level 2: HTTP Protocol

- **Task:** The flag is hidden as a username within a URL. However, the URL is encoded using a JavaScript obfuscation script.
- **Hint:** Participants must reverse-engineer the obfuscated JavaScript code to extract the hidden username.

### Level 3: DNS Protocol

- **Task:** The flag describes the attack technique used to compromise the system.
- **Hint:** The DNS header contains ASCII values representing the flag. These values must be extracted and base64-decoded to obtain the final text.

### Level 4: Encrypted TCP

- **Task:** This level contains **half** of the final password.
- **Hint:** Participants must reverse an ELF binary to obtain the decryption key, then use it to decrypt the TCP traffic. The traffic contains the first half of the password.

## 📚 Challenge Flow

1. **Token Generation Web Server**
   - A Flask web server generates a unique token every 30 seconds.
   - This token is saved to `/tmp/ssh_token.txt`.
   - It is accessible via an endpoint: `GET /token`.

2. **SSH Service Authentication**
   - A local user `ctfuser` is created on the machine.
   - Every 30 seconds, a background script reads `/tmp/ssh_token.txt` and updates the password for `ctfuser` via `chpasswd`.

3. **SSH Login**
   - Players retrieve the current token from the web server.
   - Use it as the SSH password to log in to `ctfuser@host`.

4. **In-System Web Server**
   - Once inside, the player accesses a local web app (localhost only).
   - This app displays logs from previous users.
   - These logs contain metadata (e.g., timestamps, user actions) and hints toward a side-channel or race condition vulnerability.

5. **Race Condition Exploit**
   - The player discovers a log cleaner or a vulnerable script (e.g., with a TOCTOU flaw).
   - A successful race condition gives elevated permissions or access to overwrite a file or escalate to root.

6. **Capture the Flag**
   - With root access, the player can read `/root/flag.txt`.
   - Flag format: `HTB{example_flag}`

## 🛠️ Components Breakdown

### 🔸 1. Token Web Server (`token_server.py`)
- Flask app
- Generates a new SHA-256 token every 30 seconds
- Saves token to `/tmp/ssh_token.txt`

### 🔸 2. SSH Password Updater (`update_ssh_password.sh`)
- Cron job or looped script
- Reads `/tmp/ssh_token.txt`
- Updates `ctfuser` password with `echo "ctfuser:token" | sudo chpasswd`

### 🔸 3. SSH Configuration
- User: `ctfuser`
- Shell access but limited permissions
- No sudo
- Home directory contains access to local-only web log viewer

### 🔸 4. Internal Web App (`log_viewer.py`)
- Runs locally on port 8080
- Lists logs from previous sessions
- Contains timing information or leaked info exploitable via side-channel

### 🔸 5. Race Condition Vulnerability
- Vulnerable script or SUID binary
- Example: unsafe file deletion using `os.access()` or `rm` race
- Player can exploit using symbolic links or concurrent access

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Run inside a Docker container or sandboxed VM
- Limit SSH access to localhost or internal network
- Use real but safe vulnerabilities for race condition
- Monitor for brute-force attempts

## 🏁 Flag

Located at: `/root/flag.txt`

Format: `HTB{your_final_flag_here}`

---

## 🔄 Timeline of Player Actions

1. Visit `http://<server>:5000/token` to get token
2. SSH into `ctfuser@<server>` using token as password
3. Explore local system, find and access local web server
4. Analyze logs for clues
5. Discover and exploit race condition
6. Get root shell
7. `cat /root/flag.txt`
